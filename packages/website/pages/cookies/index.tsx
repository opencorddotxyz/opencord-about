          cookies and other similar technologies are used by us on our websites
          opencord.xyz, and any subdomains thereof (which we may refer to as the
          &quot;sites&quot;) and by our partners. This helps us to provide you
          with a good experience when you browse our sites and also allows us to
          improve our sites. By continuing to browse any of our sites, you are
          agreeing to our use of cookies and similar technologies as described
          in this Policy.

        <h1 id="what-are-cookies-">What are cookies?</h1>
        <p>
          Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers
          to recognize the computer or device used to access a website. A cookie
          is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile
          device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember
          your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and
          other display preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have
          to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse
          from one page to another.
        </p>
        <h1 id="types-of-cookies-that-we-use">Types of cookies that we use</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Persistent cookies</strong> remain on your hard drive after
            you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your
            browser on subsequent visits to one of our sites until you choose to
            delete them, and otherwise typically delete themselves at
            expiration. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web
            browser&#39;s directions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Session cookies</strong> are temporary and disappear after
            you close your browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third-party cookies</strong> are placed by someone other
            than us, and may gather browsing activity across multiple websites
            and across multiple sessions. They are usually a type of persistent
            cookies and are stored until you delete them or they expire based on
            the time set in each third-party cookie.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate
          when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of our service may
          not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
