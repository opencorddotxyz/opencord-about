        <h2 id="username">Username</h2>
        <p>
          We ask you to pick a name when you create an account. This is the name
          that will displayed when you use the app. If you want your friends to
          easily recognize you, we recommend that you use a nickname if that is
          what your friends call you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember: most of the information in your profile is public and others
          can find you through the public list of followers and members of the
          communities you are a member of, or contact you using your username
          and wallet address.
        </p>
        <h2 id="wallet-or-e-mail-address-and-verification">
          Wallet or e-mail address and verification
        </h2>
        <p>
          You will need a valid crypto wallet address or e-mail to create an
          account. To make sure other people do not start creating accounts with
          your wallet address or e-mail, we ask you to verify your wallet
          address or e-mail when creating an account. Your Opencord account is
          tied to your wallet address or e-mail, so please make sure your wallet
          address or e-mail remains valid in order to continue using the
          services. If your wallet address or e-mail becomes invalid, you will
          no longer be able to access the services.

        <p>
          Opencord is a blockchain-based service. In order to provide the
          services, Opencord needs to interact with blockchains (e.g. Ethereum
          and Polygon). We will ask to connect your crypto wallet when we need
          to interact with blockchains. The services related to blockchains can
          only function properly if the wallet is connected, for example,
          setting NFT as your avatar and ENS as your username, etc.

          To the extent the parties are permitted under these terms to initiate
          litigation in a court, both you and Opencord agree that all claims and
          disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating

          in the courts of Singapore, unless this is prohibited by the laws of
          the country where you reside. You and Opencord consent to the
          exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.

          The laws of Singapore govern these terms and any claims and disputes
          (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these
          terms or their subject matter. The courts in some countries may not
          apply the laws of Singapore to some disputes related to these terms.
          If you reside in one of those countries, the laws of your home country
          may apply to those disputes.

          The following terms and conditions apply to you only if you are using
          the App from the Apple App Store: To the extent the other terms and
          conditions of these Terms are less restrictive than, or otherwise
          conflict with, the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the more
          restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this paragraph
          apply, but solely with respect to your use of the App from the Apple
          App Store. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms are solely
          between you and Opencord, not Apple, and that Apple has no
          responsibility for the App or content thereof. Your use of the App
          must comply with the App Store’s applicable terms of use. You
          acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any
          maintenance and support services with respect to the App. In the event
          of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you
          may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any,
          for the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
          Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect
          to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs
          or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty
          will be solely governed by these Terms. You acknowledge that Apple is
          not responsible for addressing any claims of yours or any third party
          relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App,
          including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims, (b) any
          claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or
          regulatory requirement, and (c) claims arising under consumer
          protection or similar legislation. You acknowledge that, in the event
          of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of
          that App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights,
          Opencord, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation,
          defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property
          infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms. You must
          comply with applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the
          App. You acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries,
          are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to your
          use of the App, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple
          will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to
          enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
