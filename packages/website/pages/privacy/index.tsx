          We store your information as long as necessary and as long as
          you&#39;re a user of our service. Also note that we aggregate or

        <h1 id="control-over-your-information">
          Control over your information
        </h1>
        <p>
          It is very important to us that you have control over your
          information! Here are some ways we establish just that:
        </p>
        <h2 id="access">Access</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to let you access and update most of the personal
          information that we have about you. Most of this can be done in the
          profile section of the app. If you need to access, update, or delete
          any other personal information that we may have, you can contact
          team@opencord.xyz.
        </p>
        <h2 id="correct">Correct</h2>
        <p>
          You can also request us to correct your data. For example, if you
          think your NFT information is incorrect, you can send an update
          request directly in the application.
        </p>
        <h2 id="deletion">Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          You can easily delete information in the application, for example any
          messages you&#39;ve sent (including media like images and videos) or
          friends you&#39;ve followed.
        </p>
        <h2 id="account-deletion">Account deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We don&#39;t want to see you leave us, but if for some reason you want
          to delete your account, you can always contact us at
          team@opencord.xyz, or do it directly from within the application.
        </p>
        <h2 id="right-to-object">Right to object</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to object to our use of your information. For some
          types of data (e.g your twitter username), you can simply delete it
          from Opencord and it will not be processed anymore. For other types of
          data that are crucial to the functioning of Opencord, you can delete
          your account to stop us from processing your information. This can be
          done from within the app, or you can drop a note to team@opencord.xyz
          and we can talk you through the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, it may be necessary to save your personal data (such as
          your wallet address) to the blockchain in order to provide the
          services to you (such as interacting with the blockchain). When
          deleting an account, we may not be able to ensure that your personal
          data on the blockchain has been deleted. This is because the
          blockchain is a public decentralized network, and any personal data
          shared on the blockchain will be publicly posted, and your right to
          delete may not be fully enforced. In this case, we can only ensure
          that all personal data we hold is permanently deleted. If you want to
          ensure that your privacy rights are not affected in any way, you
          should not conduct transactions or other interactions on the
          blockchain.

          clauses, and we rely on the European Commission&#39;s adequacy
          decisions about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally
          compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer.
