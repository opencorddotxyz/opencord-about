We may obtain information from other companies we own or operate or from any other third party source and combine it with information we normally collect through our services.

We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf and business partners that provide services and functionality,  including partners who show Opencord ads on their platforms.

### With third-party applications

We provide you with the ability to interact with third party applications through the Opencord plugin. We may share information about you, such as your crypto wallet address, list of people you follow and list of communities you join, with the third party applications or services you use.

### With third parties for legal reasons

We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:

- comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation
- investigate, remedy, or enforce potential terms of service violations

- detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns

## With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition

If Opencord gets involved in a merger, asset sale, stock sale, share sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes. 

## With the world

If you decide to publicly share information, for example, if you decide to share your posts using a web link, or invite members to join your community.

Also be aware that your friends may take screenshots of the app and/or share some information about their interactions with you on Opencord.

# Third-party content and integrations

Our services may also contain third-party links and include third-party integrations. Through these links and third-party integrations, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.

# How long will we keep your information

We store your information as long as necessary and as long as you're a user of our service. Also note that we aggregate or anonymize information for certain purposes such as data analytics. Once we've anonymized the data, we retain it indefinitely.

The following data is stored as long as you are actively using the Opencord app:

- your name, username, crypto wallet address and e-mail
- your profile
- your list of followers and communities you've joined
- your chats, images, attach files and posts
- your device and usage information

As a basic principle, we only keep the data we need to provide you with our services.

# Control over your information

It is very important to us that you have control over your information! Here are some ways we establish just that:

## Access

We strive to let you access and update most of the personal information that we have about you. Most of this can be done in the profile section of the app. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information that we may have, you can contact team@opencord.xyz. 

## Correct

You can also request us to correct your data. For example, if you think your NFT information is incorrect, you can send an update request directly in the application.

## Deletion

You can easily delete information in the application, for example any messages you've sent (including media like images and videos) or friends you've followed. 

## Account deletion

We don't want to see you leave us, but if for some reason you want to delete your account, you can always contact us at team@opencord.xyz, or do it directly from within the application.

## Right to object

You have the right to object to our use of your information. For some types of data (e.g your twitter username), you can simply delete it from Opencord and it will not be processed anymore. For other types of data that are crucial to the functioning of Opencord, you can delete your account to stop us from processing your information. This can be done from within the app, or you can drop a note to team@opencord.xyz and we can talk you through the process.

In some cases, it may be necessary to save your personal data (such as your wallet address) to the blockchain in order to provide the services to you (such as interacting with the blockchain). When deleting an account, we may not be able to ensure that your personal data on the blockchain has been deleted. This is because the blockchain is a public decentralized network, and any personal data shared on the blockchain will be publicly posted, and your right to delete may not be fully enforced. In this case, we can only ensure that all personal data we hold is permanently deleted. If you want to ensure that your privacy rights are not affected in any way, you should not conduct transactions or other interactions on the blockchain.

# International data transfers

We process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.

When transferring data outside the EEA, we use standard contract clauses, and we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer.

We're always happy to answer any questions you may have about our international data transfer principles. If you do have any questions, please reach out to us at team@opencord.xyz.

# Children

Our services are not intended for anyone under the age of 13, and we do not direct them to anyone under the age of 13. That is why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. Additionally, you must be old enough to consent to the processing of your information in your country.

# Revisions to the privacy policy

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we'll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we'll let you know by revising the date at the top of the privacy policy (which is available on our website and in our app). Other times, especially if there is a major change, we'll provide you with additional notice, such as adding a statement to our websites' homepages or providing you with an in-app notification.
