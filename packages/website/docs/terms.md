Welcome :)

Opencord is a web3 native social platform built for DAOs. It is designed for the efficient connections of DAOs, the seamless connections of DApps, and the like-mindedness connections of DAO friends.

We've drafted these terms of service (the "terms") so you'll know the rules that apply when you use the Opencord app or any of our other products or services that link to these terms (the "services"). These terms are a legally binding agreement between you ("**you**" or "**yours**") and Opencord Lab LTD ("**Opencord,**" "**we,**" "**us,**" or "**our**"). Please read them carefully.

In order to use the services, you must have accepted these terms, which are presented to you (i) when you first open the app and (ii) when we make any material changes to the terms. of course, if you don't accept them, then don't use the services.

## Wallet or e-mail address and verification

Opencord may also terminate these terms with you if you fail to comply with these terms, the law, or for any reason outside of our control. And while we will try to give you advance notice, we cannot guarantee it. Our right to terminate these terms means that we may stop providing you with any services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the services.
