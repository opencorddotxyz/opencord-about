# üî® How it is made?

Opencord is a web3 native social application covering all platforms.

We are committed to building a better social network with the latest blockchain technology, allowing everyone to surf the Web3 freely.

The technologies we use mainly include:

1. Use @Metamask and @WalletConnect to connect wallet to login account
2. Use @ENS as username and NFT as avatar
3. Use @Polygon‚Äôs crypto assets (e.g. ERC20, ERC721) to set up token gating
4. Use @OpenZepplin's ERC20 template as our official Token smart contract base
5. Use @IPFS to store decentralized data, such as social graphs, voting records, etc.
6. Use @Chainlink to interact with off-chain data.
